  * DETAILS: Outlines the upgrade process
  ***************************************/

Upgrading Program O, starting with version 2.1.0, will be a "semi-automatic" process, in that, with
major revisions (e.g. 2.0 to 2.1, 2.1 to 2.2, etc), there will be a file in the install folder named
upgrade.php, the presence of which will cause that file to be run, and any upgrade processes or tasks
will be performed. If all upgrade tasks are completed, the script will delete it's own file from the
install folder, to prevent any future mis-configurations. Part of the upgrade scripts tasks will be
to first verify that the upgrade has not already been completed, and if they have been, it will again
attempt to delete itself, and then pass control back to the main script. If the file can't be deleted,
it will notify the botmaster by email (if an email address has been configured).

Please note that minor revision updates will ~NOT~ be affected, and will not include an upgrade script.

However, when upgrading from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1, you **will** need to run the upgrade script upgrade_230_231.php
manually. This file is also in the install folder.

Also, on new installations of Program O, the installation script will also try to delete upgrade.php
(since it won't be needed), and will also try to notify the botmaster in case of failure to delete the
file.

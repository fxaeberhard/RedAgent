		<h2>July 5 2015, Ludum Dare Game Jam 16</h2>

		<p>
			In game jams, it's always hard to to settle on an idea. Even though we ere only two, it took one full day to have this one. It's a two player rythm game on phone. Each holds one end of the phone and need to move it up when his side of the swing goes down.

		<p>
			Great week-end, but we failed to finish a playable version of this game. But we swore we would finish it soon. Wait and see then...

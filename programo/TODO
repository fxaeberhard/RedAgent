  ***************************************/


  1.) Bug Fix: "clear properties" still generates a new user_id - MUST be fixed! - HIGH PRIORITY

  2.) Bug Fix: Re-formulate the SQL query for finding proper AIML categories, as some catagories that
      use a <that> tag are being missed

  3.) Add functionality for botmasters to see what inputs triggered the default
      response category, so that they may be able to more easily determine what
      AIML categories need to be added.

  4.) Add a page to the admin script that helps botmasters create new AIML categories
      based on the functionality mentioned in item 1, above.

  5.) Add a page to the admin script that allows botmasters to edit the config file
      directly.

  6.) Add functionality to the downloads section of the admin to download multiple
      AIML files ad a single zip file.

  7.) Add row count for AIML files in the admin/download page
      "select count(*) from aiml where filename = '$fileName'"

  8.) Create/modify some bot-level configurable default values so that botmasters can use their own
      values, based on their chatbot's "native language".

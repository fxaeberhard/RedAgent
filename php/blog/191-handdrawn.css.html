			When you design interfaces, you need to consider graphic design, user experience and implementation all at the same time. To simplify this very complex issue and have a document on which people with those three specialities, I very often use my more complex
			projects with an initial wireframe prototype, which is either done with mockup tools or directly in code.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main issue with wireframe prototyping is that people tend to consider visual aspects of the definitive. One nice trick is to use hand drawn theme so it is very clear to all viewer that it is not the definitive appearance of the site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Handdrawn.css is a plug and play library that turn your proptotype into handrawn theme and can be used with bootstrap.
